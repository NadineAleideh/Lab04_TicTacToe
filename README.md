# TicTacToe Console App

## What is TicTacToe?

A 3x3 grid is used for the traditional paper and pencil game of tic tac toe. Two players alternately fill in grid squares with their respective symbols (often a 'X' and a 'O') until one player creates a winning pattern or all spaces are filled, in which case the game is a draw. This project uses C# to implement the TicTacToe game on a console.
